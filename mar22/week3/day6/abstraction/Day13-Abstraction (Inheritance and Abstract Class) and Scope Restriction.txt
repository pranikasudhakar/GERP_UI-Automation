Week3 - day2:
=============

Abstraction:
==============
What is abstraction: Hiding the implementation details. 

Car - Know how to drive the car but I do no the internal detail of the car. If any problem I will not know how to fix but comfortably able to drive the car. Car mechanic be able to fix it.

 - Interface - Full Abstraction
 - Abstract Class - Partial Abstraction
 
 Plot & Budget, you go to architect to build the plan (Design) for house with the requirement for house (2BHK, Kitchen, Balcony, etc)
 Without plan we can build the house, say small house. If you want to build a proper house you need plan (design).
 In Java, Interface is used to design the framework.

What is an Interface? API is an interface. In Java, Interface is used to design the framework.
Example: 

RBI -> Reserve Bank of India (Regulatory Body for all the bank in India) - Bank of Banks - Give the guidenlines for all the Bank

To understand interface Concept:
=================================

In IDE, New -> Interface

void fixedDeposit(); 
{} - Body of the method / Implementation which is not there in Interface method

Properties of Interface:
========================
- All the methods in the interface are unimplemented methods (only method signature exist and no implementation)
Ex: void fixedDeposit();
void savingsAccount();

public abstract void fixedDeposit();

- By default all the methods are public abstract so you dont need to declare public for a method.

Note: We cannot have private or protected abstract or method within the abstract

- Abstract means unimplemented
- If there is a interface, it should be implemented in a class

Excercise:
============
Class IOB implements RBI (Implements is the keyword for Interface)

Selenium WebDriver -> To automate Web Application

Chrome -> ChromeDriver (Google)
Edge -> EdgeDriver (Microsoft)
Firefox -> FirefoxDriver (Mozilla)
IE - IEDriver - Created by Selenium community
Safari -> SafariDriver (Apple)

to load -> get
to locate -> findElement
To enter value -> sendKeys

Class A implements RBi, CIBIL(){

implement all the method - Multiple Inheritance
}


Scope Restriction:
